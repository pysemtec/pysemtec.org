# Motivation

Python is probably the most important language in numerical AI (often called "machine learning"). However, in the field of semantic technologies (knowledge graphs, ontologies, description logics, ...) Python support currently seems to be surprisingly sparse. This project – *python-related semantic technologies* – aims to connect people and organizations with interest both in Python and semantic technologies.



# Resources & Communication

To facilitate exchange of knowledge and ideas and to ideally spawn cooperation, the following resources exists:

- A [repository](https://github.com/pysemtec/semantic-python-overview) which collects projects related to both Python and semantic technologies. Feel free to contribute via PR or mail.
- A [mailing list](https://lists.pysemtec.org/postorius/lists/pysemtec.lists.pysemtec.org/) which serves as the canonical communication medium of the community.
- A [![Gitter Chat](https://badges.gitter.im/pysemtec/community.svg)](https://gitter.im/pysemtec/community?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge) which serves as low-barrier ad-hoc communication medium. You can also join using Matrix:<br> [https://matrix.to/#/#pysemtec_community:gitter.im?utm_source=gitter](https://matrix.to/#/#pysemtec_community:gitter.im?utm_source=gitter).
- [This static website](https://pysemtec.org/), which might be extended with links and subpages.
